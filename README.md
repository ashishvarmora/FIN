I am a passionate developer specializing in finance-focused Python tools designed to streamline accounting and data extraction tasks. My latest project automates the extraction of GST numbers from multiple bills using efficient scanning and parsing techniques, saving valuable time and reducing manual errors. The tool compiles the extracted GST data into structured CSV files for easy integration with accounting software and further analysis. I focus on creating practical, user-friendly solutions that enhance financial data management and accuracy.
